Pt. 2: React-Final-Exam 
Use create-react-app to create a project called <your name>-react-final (e.g. jdrichards-react-final)
Delete the src folder and create your own with index.js for DOM creation and App.js for the main folder
Create component for Header.js.
		Header.js should just have an <h1> with your name (e.g. JD Richards React Final) 
		Give the header a light background
In the other components in the app you will consume this api:
Endpoint: https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers
See the video for the visual format you should try to achieve.
Your app ideally should have 5 components (inclusive of App.js and index.js and Header.js)
If you can only do it with 4 components then do it with 4.
Get all the correct data listed first (look at the video), element placement is second most important.
Create a git repository and post the link to the exam to: https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/NDM4NDIyMzg1NDda/a/ODA2ODA3NjA0Njha/details
Good luck!
